      sudo ./cleanup_docker.sh
      ```

3. `Optional` If the network of the system is running behind proxy, please configure the proxy for both http and https:

      ```
      export http_proxy=http://<user.pass>@<company>:<server_port> 
      export https_proxy=http://<user.pass>@<company>:<server_port> 
      
      ```
